Hi, and welcome to my website! My name is Jake Nocentino, and I am a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. I am 25 years old and currently living in Seattle, WA.

A bit more about my background; I grew up in the great state of New Jersey, where I had fallen in love with puzzling at a young age. During my high school years, I started to tinker with technology, and realized it scratched the same itch as puzzling. I declared my computer science major for college, and the rest is history.

I attended Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania from 2017 - 2021 and attained my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics. After college, I worked at Vanguard for a year, honing my skills as a software engineer. I knew I wanted to challenge myself more within my career, and made the shift to Amazon Web Services in Seattle, WA.

Outside of software engineering, I love nature, rock climbing, hiking, spending time with friends and family, running, the gym, and jigsaw/crossword puzzles! :)
